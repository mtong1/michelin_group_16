## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
crash_data<-read_csv("/home/mtong1/Downloads/Crash data_LA_county.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
crash_2019 <-
  crash_data %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2019)

unique(crash_2019$YEAR)

write_csv(crash_2019, here("data", "crash_2019.csv"))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
